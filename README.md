## Developing

Install `pnpm` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Run the development server, which builds and compiles the site as you edit:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Edit the website files, `index.html`, `404.html` and `src/*` and see the changes appear as you save them.

This site uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com).
