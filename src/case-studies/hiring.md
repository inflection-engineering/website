## Context

![Context](/assets/context.svg){.icon-right}

A SaaS scale-up needed to grow fast. Leadership knew the hires they needed, but hiring was ad-hoc, interviewers were few, and no real process existed. With a fixed budget, every decision mattered.

They didnâ€™t need recruiters, they needed a trusted partner who worked as they would themselves designing, building and bootstrapping the hiring system, bringing existing staff along for the journey.

## Alignment

![Approach](/assets/approach.svg){.icon-right}

We anchored workshops around three hard questions:

\- **What do we need?** A shopping list of roles, levels, costs, urgency.
\- **Where will they come from?** Agencies, agreements, targeting.
\- **How will we choose?** Interview framework, rigour, decisions, capacity.

Once agreed, we acted autonomously updating only at key decision points while iterating the plan as new market data arrived.

## Delivery

\- **Boots on the ground.** We started hiring immediately: building pipelines, talking to candidates, interviewing ourselves. Senior hires landed early, boosting capacity and proving the model. AI note-taking cut admin while raising accountability.
\- **Framework.** Alongside execution, we stood up the basics: job descriptions, interview loops, scripts, rubrics, and debriefs. Lightweight but predictable, designed to train others.
\- **Leave a working solution.** We trained staff and new senior hires to become interviewers, coached evidence-based interviewing, and transitioned ownership to in-house recruiting so the system would persist.
