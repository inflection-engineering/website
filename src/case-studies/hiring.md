# Accelerating hiring 

## Context 
![Context](https://picsum.photos/seed/context/600/400/){.img-right}

A SaaS scale-up needed to grow fast. Leadership knew the hires they needed, but hiring was ad-hoc, interviewers were few, and no real process existed. With a fixed budget, every decision mattered.

They didn’t need recruiters — they needed a trusted partner who worked as they would themselves designing, building and bootstrapping the hiring system, bringing existing staff along for the journey.  


## Alignment

We anchored workshops around three hard questions:


* **What do we need?** A shopping list of roles, levels, costs, urgency.
* **Where will they come from?** Agencies, agreements, targeting.
* **How will we choose?** Interview framework, rigour, decisions, capacity.

Once agreed, we acted autonomously — updating only at key decision points while iterating the plan as new market data arrived

- **Boots on the ground.** We started hiring immediately — building pipelines, talking to candidates, interviewing ourselves. Senior hires landed early, boosting capacity and proving the model. AI note-taking cut admin while raising accountability.
- **Framework.** Alongside execution, we stood up the basics: job descriptions, interview loops, scripts, rubrics, and debriefs. Lightweight but predictable, designed to train others.
- **Leave a working solution.** We trained staff and new senior hires to become interviewers, coached evidence-based interviewing, and transitioned ownership to in-house recruiting so the system would persist.

- ~85% of roles hired or under offer.
- 400 candidates reviewed, >150 screened, 8+ perm hires made, 1 offer open.
- Contractors added for critical gaps (SWE, SRE, recruiting).
- *A trained interviewer pool, leadership hires to run loops, and in-house recruiting capacity established.*
- A working hiring engine that leaders could trust to keep scaling.
