  When fragile infrastructure demanded migration but downtime wasn't an option, we orchestrated a never-attempted-before move. We aligned 1,800 people across 40 teams in a three-day stop-the-line release. AWS later made it _their_ The Playbook.

Kafka sat on the hot path for nearly every business function. Built quickly and well, it had grown fragile, complex, and under-supported. A major incident showed how thin operational knowledge had become. Migration to managed services was critical, but downtime wasn’t an option. No migration of this scale had ever been attempted, not even by the cloud provider. The choice was stark: keep running fragile infrastructure, or attempt the impossible.

The hurdles weren’t only technical. Success meant moving an org of 1,800-strong in lockstep. This included product, data science, and all of engineering, with over 40 teams playing starring roles in a three-day stop-the-line release.
This demanded more than supporting the team. It meant keeping leaders confident but patient, securing commitment for the risky cutover, and maintaining relentless, crisp communication to align the org.

No film crew caught it, but AWS later called it _The Playbook_.
