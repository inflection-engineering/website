Kafka sat on the hot path for nearly every business function. Built quickly and well, it had grown fragile, complex, and under-supported. A major incident showed how thin operational knowledge had become. Migration to managed services was critical, but downtime wasn’t an option — and no migration of this scale had ever been attempted, not even by the cloud provider. The choice was stark: keep running fragile infrastructure, or attempt the impossible.

The hurdles weren’t only technical. Success meant moving an 1,800-strong org in lockstep — product, data science, and all of engineering with over 40 teams playing starring roles — through a three-day, stop-the-line release. I kept leaders confident but patient, secured commitment for a risky big-bang cutover, and drilled comms until the whole org was aligned. No film crew caught it, but AWS later called it _The Playbook_.
