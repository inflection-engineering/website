At a SaaS scale-up, growth was pressing. The client knew exactly what was needed: a significant expansion of engineering headcount. The gap was in execution capacity and rigour — few interviewers, no consistent process, and little experience of hiring at scale. The likely outcome was failure to hire fast enough, or hiring badly.

We built the plan with him, then executed it alongside him — aligned to his goals but without demanding his minute-to-minute involvement. Running loops, refining scripts, training interviewers, and onboarding tools, we gave him space to focus on other priorities while building his organisation’s own capacity to hire at scale.
