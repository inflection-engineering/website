  When reliability work looked like a tax on productivity, we reframed it through the customer experience. It let teams engage deeper in reliability as part of their success, not at the cost of it.

At one large scale-up, product features came with compelling business cases and clear metrics; reliability work didnâ€™t. Teams put in the effort, but it looked like a tax on productivity rather than an investment. Without a shared way to credit progress, motivations stayed misaligned and the company lacked a common view of value.

We reframed the thinking, delivering a prioritisation model that defined work focus through the customer experience. This model enabled all teams to engage deeper in reliability work framed as part of their success, not at the cost of it.
