## You have too many plates spinning

Your systems are strained. Your team is stretched. What worked six months ago doesn't scale to the next six.

Fighting fires all day leaves **no time for strategy**. We've fought these fires before — we land running, take problems off your hands, resolve them, _and_ grow your team so you don't need to step in again.

We work in **fixed engagements**. We solve the immediate crisis. We transfer knowledge. We don't stay longer than we're needed.

This is what we're built for: the high-stakes inflection points where the right partner makes all the difference.

## What JP brings

![JP](/assets/JP.png){.img-right}

JP scales **organisations and engineering products** under pressure.

He was Deliveroo's principal engineer, influencing the 1,800 tech organisation across 50+ teams. He led marketing, growth, payments, and infrastructure engineering teams over 9 years, as the company grew from 6 engineers to 600, through funding rounds, hypergrowth, IPO prep, and profitability.

**He makes reliability prioritisable.** When incidents kept recurring, JP created [Hyperfocus](/case-studies/hyperfocus/) — a framework that gave reliability work the same weight as features and ended the cycle of fire-fighting.

**He builds systems that scale.** JP architected Deliveroo's _distributed experimentation platform_ (hundreds of experiments, zero blast radius), their _event-sourced payments system_ (optimised for cost at massive scale), and blinkbox' _book ingestion platform_ (turning daily snapshots of 500k ebooks into concise delta events that drove everything from push notifications to their physical ebook reader).

**He moves fast, and unbreaks things.** Whether the single code-line prototype for Deliveroo Plus, [hiring 85% of roles in a scale-up](/case-studies/hiring/), or coaching senior staff engineers on building products like a business _owner_.

JP adapts to what you need: strategic leader, hands-on engineer, experienced coach.

## What Mike brings

![Mike](/assets/mike.png){.img-right}

Mike keeps **infrastructure reliable** and **coaches leadership** through the decisions that matter most.

He's been central to leadership teams at _Demon Internet_ (UK's first consumer ISP), _Redbus Interhouse_ (revolutionising UK data centres), and platform teams at _Facebook_ and _Deliveroo_. He's told boards when it was time to shut down, navigated acquisitions and IPOs, and given technical founders the faith they need to back big-bang migrations when gradual approaches wouldn't work.

**He orchestrates impossible migrations.** Mike led a [zero-downtime Kafka migration](/case-studies/migration/) across 40+ teams and 30k messages/second — something the cloud provider said had never been done. It became their playbook.

**He shields engineers while earning leadership trust.** Mike distills technical depth into clarity for boards, and translates business constraints into actionable plans for teams.

**He's closed the doors.** Mike has told boards when it was time to shut down. He's navigated acquisitions, funding rounds, IPOs. He knows what real stakes look like.

Mike gives you confidence: in the migration, the architecture decision, the midnight incident response.

## Why we work as a team

![Two lighthouses lighting one spot from two directions](/assets/twin.png){.img-right}

At Deliveroo, we built a repeating pattern that works: identify the _systemic_ problem, align the organisation, execute the change, leave it working and self-healing.

**We migrated Kafka with zero customer impact** — 40+ teams, 30k messages/second, no downtime. AWS turned it into their playbook. **We stopped recurring incidents** by making reliability work as visible as features. **We hired 85% of open roles** and left a trained team to scale it. **We never slowed product velocity** to do any of it.

Together, we're more effective than separately:

**Broader range.** Product + infrastructure. Org design + execution. Engineering strategy + hands-on delivery.

**Faster trust.** One of us earns credibility with engineers, the other with leadership. We translate in both directions.

**Lower risk.** We've worked through crises together. We know each other's judgment. You get a team that's already aligned.

You're not hiring two contractors. You're getting a **unit that's solved problems like yours before**.
