## We've done this before

We’ve learned we’re at our best in inflection points, those high-stakes moments where systems strain, leadership is stretched, and what worked yesterday no longer holds.

For us this isn’t theory. It’s the work we’ve lived, the work we love, and the work we now choose to optimise our careers around. Think of it as a sweet spot: what we’re great at, what gives us energy, and what your business most needs.

That’s what _Inflection Engineering_ means,  leaning into complex challenges not as a burden, but as the place we do our best work.

## Who is JP?

![JP](/assets/JP.png){.img-right}

JP’s major chops come from Deliveroo. He joined in the early days and lived every stage of the journey funding, hypergrowth, IPO readiness, and the shift to profitability.

Along the way he learned how to adjust his style to each phase: from principal engineer influencing an 1,800-strong organisation, to the coder roughing out a fix in the middle of the night. He is strategic when working on hiring plans and architecture reviews, a coach helping ICs and managers grow, and a maverick when coding for a NASA challenge on a shoestring budget. He knows the strain of scaling teams, aligning leadership, and shipping product under relentless pressure.

## Who is Mike?

Mike brings an infrastructure-first lens shaped by decades of scale-up leadership. A Central part of the leadership team that built that Demon Internet, the UK’s first consumer ISP; Co-founded Redbus Interhouse, building a spreadsheet into a funded business that revolutionised the UK data centre market; steered companies through acquisitions; navigated sales, funding rounds and multiple IPOs.  Mike has told the board it was time, and closed the doors. 

He’s led teams owning key tools in the security and developer workflows ensuring they performed at Facebook scale, and has persuaded start-up engineers to go on call for the first time — ill-prepared and nervous, but confident because he had their back. 

Mike knows what it looks like to run a scrappy start-up, a high-growth scale-up, and a global tech giant — and what it takes to keep systems reliable when complexity becomes the beast in the room.

## Why a team?

At Deliveroo, JP joined Mike’s platform organisation and together we built a repeatable pattern for systemic change across a fast-growing tech company. It was not only about developer tooling and platforms, we reshaped hiring models, consolidated disparate technologies, and pulled off groundbreaking scale migrations that later became AWS case studies. We introduced frameworks to weigh risk reduction against product growth, ran cost-reduction programmes that elevated capability instead of cutting corners, and created the conditions for technology to scale sustainably.

In short,  through  a broader combined skillset, low ego, and high-functioning collaboration and some unusually high EQ we've become disproportionately impactful as a team, delivering extraordinary change in scale-up environments? 

Now, we seek work that gives us the same **joy**: high-stakes moments where our unusual experience makes the biggest difference. These are the moments we know best, the ones we love, and where we help leadership teams accelerate when it matters most.
